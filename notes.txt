find the power of 2 (leetcode question). another aproach.
we can find number of set bits of a number if set bits are even then that number is power of 2 and if set bits are odd then it is not 

create a program using switch case that how many particular notes(100,500,1000) are required to make a particular amount (question in lecture8 of codehelp)

// even or odd / gotta understand this concept
int isEven (int n ){
    if (n&1)
    {
        return 0; // odd
    }
    return 1; // even
}
